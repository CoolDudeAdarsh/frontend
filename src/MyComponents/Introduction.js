      <h5 style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: '10px 30px 40px ' , color: 'lavenderblush'}}>Learning is a continuous process that involves the transformation of information and experience into 
        abilities and knowledge. Learning, according to us, is a two way process that involves the learner 
        and the educator leading to knowledge acquisition as well as capability.
        
        It informs my educational sector by making sure that both the students and the teacher participate 
        during the learning process to make it more real and enjoyable so that the learners can clearly 
        understand. There are many and different learning concepts held by students and ways in which 
        the different views affect teaching and learning.</h5>
